# Go landlock library

The Go landlock library restricts the Go runtime's ability to use
files, using Linux 5.13's Landlock feature. ([Package
documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gnoack/golandlock))

For a more low-level interface, please see [the golandlock/syscall
package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gnoack/golandlock/syscall).
